# Gett - Insights from Failed Orders
**Gett**, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM).
They have an application where clients can order taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers). At the moment, when the client clicks the Order button in the application,
the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers them the order.

ðŸŒŸ In this task, I have investigated some matching metrics for orders that were not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car. To showcase the insights unearthed,
I have prepared a Tableau report whose design is inspired by the original website of [Gett](https://gett.com/uk).

_This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Gett._
